export const mission2 = `....If you've read my CV you'll know I've been working in Digital Health for a number of years, it's a unique and difficult industry where experience in the field can really make a difference, it's also an industry filled with untapped potential. I believe that if the right company can take the right approach to making digital health products then healthcare in the UK and worldwide would massively benefit, and I think the key to this is creating commercial quality applications with a focus on patient acquisition. Onbaord patients first, gather and analyse the data, improve the patient experience and provide healthcare providers with the analytics they need to streamline their processes. I've worked with Patients Know Best and InHealthcare during my time at MSK assist, and I'm currently with OCC for SES STP who are also trying to develop a connected health records project, I'd be interested to hear about your approach.`;
